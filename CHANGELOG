# 3.0.0
- Make BookReader easier to use, by adding `options` to the constructor, and adding new `options.data` option. The old way of overriding properties should still work, but it is deprecated.
- Factor out extra features into plugins. See `plugins` directory. Example plugins include:
    - plugins.chapters.js - render chapter markers
    - plugins.search.js - add search ui, and callbacks
    - plugins.tts.js - add tts (read aloud) ui, sound library, and callbacks
    - plugins.url.js - automatically updates the browser url
    - plugins.resume.js - uses cookies to remember the current page
- Clean up code: Remove a lot of commented-out code. Remove some unused methods.
- Change some, but not all, CSS ids to classes.
